# Bio

## Long [ENG]

I am the VP of Engineering at Spacelift, a Golang developer, and a CloudNative practitioner. At Spacelift, I work on a collaborative platform for Infrastructure-as-a-Code - all in Go with heavy use of AWS Lambdas, various CloudNative projects, and the OpenPolicyAgent framework. I have many years of experience as a technical lead, system engineer, and developer. I led platform teams at Codility and the engineering at Hypatos (Fintech/ML SaaS). Before, as a system engineer and developer, I worked at Lyke (Rocket-Internet Venture, fashion marketplace) and Cloud&Heat (public IaaS with Open Stack).
